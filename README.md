# IntusTest
Dev Task for Intus

I've added this solution task into one single repo for both backend and frontend projects. After pulling, need to install all required packages of frontend project only via "npm i" command.<br/><br/>
This frontend angular project has constructed by angular 13 version and the backend, asp.net web-api project has made by .netcore version 5 along with Newtonsoft json framework.<br/><br/>
The completion of task requirements are briefly describe in the PDF file attach with this repo, named: "IntusTest-Readme.pdf".
